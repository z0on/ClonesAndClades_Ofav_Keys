### Bleaching and recovery of *Orbicella faveolata* in the Florida Keys depending on coral clone and type of algal symbiont 

This is a collection of R scripts and datasets to accompany the paper Manzello et al, "Role of host genetics and heat tolerant algal symbionts in sustaining populations of the endangered coral *Orbicella faveolata* in the Florida Keys with ocean warming", Global Change Biology 2019, in press.

R scripts have comments in them to explain what is going on.
